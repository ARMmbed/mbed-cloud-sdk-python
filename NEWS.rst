ConnectAPI: - Use a different api backend for consistency when
retrieving resource values. -
``set_resource_value``/``set_resource_value_async`` no longer execute a
resource (use ``execute_resource`` instead). - Add a timeout parameter
to set_resource_value - Add a timeout parameter to
execute_resource_value - SDKs now iterate subscriptions in order to
delete them.

-  Added webhook notification handler
-  AsyncConsumer.wait()

.. _known-issues-1:

Known Issues
~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Testing shows that ``get_resource_value`` will fail when the cloud
   service returns a value directly, rather than through an open
   notification channel. This affects all previous versions.
-  The only known workaround at present is to ensure the cloud cache is
   not used by:

   -  Waiting between calls to get_resource_value
   -  Reducing `the configured TTL`_ on the cloud client image on the
      device
